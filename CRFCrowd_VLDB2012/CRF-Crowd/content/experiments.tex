\section{Experiments}
\sean{Use this section to show correctness of our method with respect to CRF IE task.}
\subsection{Entropy vs. Inaccuracy}
\sean{Experiments showing correlation of high marginal entropy with inaccuracy of CRF.}
\subsection{Uncertainty Reduction}
\sean{Experiments showing uncertainty reduction in DB after applying each of our methods.  Will probably put a couple different application domain experiments here.  We already have one for citation labeling.  Ideally, we need an experiment that utilizes Bayes Nets and another that utilizes skip-chain CRFs.}
