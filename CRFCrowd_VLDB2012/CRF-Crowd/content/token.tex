\section{Question Formulation}
\sean{We seek to select tokens or sets of tokens from sequences to formulate into questions to ask the Turkers.  Here we go motivate the need to selection questions which reduce a total utility function defined in terms of the entropy. THIS ENTIRE SECTION MAY BE REORGANIZED BY APPLICATION DOMAIN INSTEAD OF GRAPHICAL MODEL USED.}
\subsection{Total Utility Function}
\sean{Describe the idea behind a total utility function and what its purpose is.}
\subsection{Highest Marginal Entropy}
\sean{Selecting those tokens with the highest marginal entropy.  Briefly describe entropy here as well.}
\subsection{Linear-Chain CRFs}
\sean{Description of TUF in terms of sum of marginals of each node. Application Domain: Information Extraction}
\subsection{Application Specific Extensions to TUF}
\subsubsection{Skip-Chain CRFs/Frequency}
\sean{Discussion of different TUF that is a modification to linear-chain.  Application Domain: Information Extraction on sequences with multiple token occurrences.}
\subsubsection{2nd Extension (Dependent vs. Independent)?}
\subsection{General PGMs}
\sean{There are experiments that I want to run that may use the entropy of the markov blanket of a node in any PGM.  The TUF would be the sum of all of these markov blankets.}
