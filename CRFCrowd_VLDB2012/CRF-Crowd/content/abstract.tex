Databases can be populated either by human input or through automatic machine input. The size of most available unstructured data on the web, however, necessitates the use of the latter, but Statistical Machine Learning results always carry with them some degree of uncertainty. We propose Crowdpillar, a probabilistic database system that utilizes a machine learning component for automatic computation as well as a human correction component for resolving the most uncertain database entries. Crowdpillar exploits crowdsourcing services such as Amazon Mechanical Turks to reduce speed and cost of the human component. This paper lays out the Crowdpillar system including how data is stored and modified and discusses a number of methods for selecting which entries should be resolved by the crowd.
