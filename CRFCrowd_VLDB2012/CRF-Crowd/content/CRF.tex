\section{PGMs: Machine Learning in the Database}
\subsection{Motivation}
\sean{Describe advantages of doing machine learning from within the database}
\subsection{Probabilistic Graphical Models}
\subsubsection{Directed Models: Bayesian Nets}
\sean{Briefly review Bayes Nets.  Mention BayesStore}
\subsubsection{Undirected Models: Conditional Random Fields}
\sean{Briefly review CRFs.  Mention some PDB that has incorporated CRFs.}
\subsection{Implementation}
\sean{Subsection should probably have a different title.  Discuss how the results are stored in a PDB and how uncertainty is handled.  Here we'll get more specific with regards to schema and discuss specific applications in greater detail. We also may leave this section out completely since schema it is application specific.}
