\section{Background}
\subsection{Probabilistic Databases}
\sean{General overview of probabilistic databases and different types of PDBs.  Discuss various ways of handling uncertainty in the database and motivate advantages of a reduction in uncertainty.}
\subsection{Probabilistic Graphical Models}
\subsubsection{Directed Models: Bayesian Nets}
\sean{Brief summary of Bayes Nets.}
\subsubsection{Undirected Models: Conditional Random Fields}
\sean{Brief summary of CRFs.}
\subsubsection{PDB Applications to IE}
\sean{Discuss efforts like Bayestore and others to put PGMs in the database.  Discuss using these PGM-based PDBs for IE.}
