\section{Background}
\subsection{Probabilistic Databases}
\sean{General overview of probabilistic databases and different types of PDBs.  Discuss various ways of handling uncertainty in the database and motivate advantages of a reduction in uncertainty.}
\subsection{Probabilistic Graphical Models}
\sean{Small overview of directed and undirected models}
\subsection{PGMs in PDBs}
\sean{Present overview of PGMs implemented into either DBs or PDBs.}
\subsection{Entropy}
\sean{Present entropy as a quantization of uncertainty. Equation and brief example.}
\subsection{Amazon Mechanical Turks}
\sean{Discuss basic idea behind crowdsourcing and give AMT basics.}
